						<h1>Reprehensible Actions</h1>
						<span class="posted-on">March 26, 2021</span>
					</header>
					<p>
						It is with great sadness that we see hate in the form of racism and xenophobia raise its ugly head once again. The Marlborough Democratic Town Committee stands in support of the AAPI Community and those who understand that all people are valued regardless of ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. The recent actions against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are reprehensible. These acts of hatred as well as the deaths of Black Americans this year, underscore the racial injustice and inequality that exists at all levels of our society.
					</p>
					<p>
						"There are simply some core values and beliefs that should bring us together as Americans," President Biden said during a speech at Emory University in Atlanta on Friday. "One of them is standing together against hate, against racism, the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our nation."
					</p>
					<p>
						How can we as Connecticut citizens help to fight against racism and hate in whatever form it takes? As we are all citizens of the world, let our consideration for all people guide our actions, thoughts, and caring relationships. Let us inform ourselves and be vigilant. Especially during the last year, our town demonstrated that we are a caring community. Is it hard to expand that caring sentiment to be inclusive of all people? We can embrace our differences and rejoice in our common bonds of humanity.
					</p>
					<p>
						We condemn violence and historic and ongoing systemic racism in every form. We stand with those who are peacefully working toward a just, compassionate, and equitable world. We value dignity, respect, kindness, and equality, and it is our continuing mission to uphold these values. We are committed to examining our own implicit biases as individuals and as a community organization, and we will keep actively listening and learning.

						<h1>A Brighter Day</h1>
						<span class="posted-on">January 20, 2021</span>
					</header>
					<p>
						With the inauguration of President Joseph Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, our country begins a new chapter. Despite a deadly global pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, we can cautiously breathe a sigh of relief after years of holding our collective breath. We can take comfort in the idea that the hard work of repairing the damage has begun, and we can hope again for a future that promises the inclusion of all Americans. 
					</p>
					<p>
						History will judge the events of the last few weeks and years, and in time the picture will be clear in all its ugliness. But now, in this moment, we can exhale for a moment, secure in the promise of a brighter future.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please join the members of the Marlborough Democratic Town Committee in wishing President Biden and Vice President Harris every success in leading us all to a brighter future.

						Thank you to all who cast their ballots to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the next President and Vice President of the United States and re-elect Democrats Joe Courtney to the U.S. House of Representatives and Cathy Osten to the Connecticut State Senate.
